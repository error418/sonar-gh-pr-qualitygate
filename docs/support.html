            <p>
                This project tries to raise funds by utilizing the 
                <a href="https://github.com/sponsorware/docs">Sponsorware</a> approach.

                Some features are only accessible by sponsors until specific goals are met. The feature is released
                to the public as soon as the goal is reached.
                Swingletree works perfectly fine without these features and remains accessible to
                everyone.
            </p>

            <p>
                I hope you understand, that this approach enables me to maintain and
                further develop Swingletree more efficiently while still being able to release software
                to the open source community.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sponsorware features are marked in the documentation using the term <code>Sponsorware</code>.
