            <p>
                This project tries to raise funds by utilizing the 
                <a href="https://github.com/sponsorware/docs">Sponsorware</a> approach.

                A public release of some features is postponed until specific sponsoring
                goals are met, while Sponsors get an early access to these features.
                Swingletree works perfectly fine without these features and remains accessible to
                everyone.
            </p>

            <p>
                I hope you understand, that this approach enables me to maintain and
                further develop Swingletree more efficiently while still being able to release software
                to the open source community.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sponsorware features are marked in the docs using the term <code>Sponsorware</code>.

            <h4>How do I sponsor?</h4>

            <p>
                Sponsorships are planned to be made via GitHub Sponsors.
                Until this is completely set up you can contact me using
                <script>printMailRef("contact", "illjut.de")</script>
