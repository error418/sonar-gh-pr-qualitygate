Swingletree can write its Analysis reports to ElasticSearch. This has following benefits:

* Analysis Reports are searchable across all known repositories.
* Analysis Reports can be aggregated to reports using established tools like [Kibana][kibana] or [Grafana][grafana]
* Swingletree UI offers the `Builds` menu option
