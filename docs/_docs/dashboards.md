Grafana enables you to compose dashboards to visualize the data pushed by Swingletree to ElasticSearch.

A collection of [dashboard configurations][config] for Swingletree Metrics can be found in the management repository.
You can view a screenshot of a dashboard in the [Showcase](../../showcase.html) section.
