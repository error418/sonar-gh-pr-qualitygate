Grafana enables you to compose dashboards to visualize the data pushed by Swingletree to ElasticSearch.

An [example configuration][config] for a Swingletree Metrics dashboard can be found in the management repository.
You can view a screenshot of this dashboard in the [Showcase](../../showcase.html) section.
