[Twistlock][twistlock] is a security scanner for containers. It can scan docker containers for vulnerabilities and compliance violations.

## Sending a scan report to Swingletree

A Swingletree webhook is published when the Twistlock Plugin is enabled.
It accepts a Twistlock scan report (generated by the twistlock cli) in JSON format as a payload and needs some additional query parameters to link the report to a GitHub repository:

```
POST /webhook/twistlock?org=[GitHub Organization]&repo=[Repository name]&sha=[Commit SHA]
```

It is recommended to protect your webhook endpoint. If you enabled webhook protection you will need to provide the authentication credentials via Basic Authentication.

Swingletree will process the report and send a Check Run Status with the context `security/twistlock` to the given GitHub coordinates.
