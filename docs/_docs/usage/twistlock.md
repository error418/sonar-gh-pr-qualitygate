[Twistlock][twistlock] is a security scanner for containers. It can scan docker containers for vulnerabilities and compliance violations.

## Sending a scan report to Swingletree

A Swingletree webhook is published when the Twistlock Plugin is enabled.
It accepts a Twistlock scan report (generated by the twistlock cli) in JSON format as a payload and needs some additional query parameters to link the report to a GitHub repository:

```
POST /webhook/twistlock?org=[GitHub Organization]&repo=[Repository name]&sha=[Commit SHA]
```

It is recommended to protect your webhook endpoint. If you enabled webhook protection you will need to provide the authentication credentials via Basic Authentication.

Swingletree will process the report and send a Check Run Status with the context `security/twistlock` to the given GitHub coordinates.

## Repository-specific Configuration

Repository-specific behaviour can be configured by placing a `.swingletree.yaml` in the repository root directory. Swingletree reads from the master branch file only.

Swingletree fails on any findings, if no `.swingletree.yaml` is available in the repository.

```yaml
plugin:
  twistlock:
    # vulnerabilities equal or above this severity require developer action
    thresholdVulnerability: high
    # vulnerabilities equal or above this cvss score require developer action
    thresholdCvss: 8
    # compliance issues equal or above this severity require developer action
    thresholdCompliance: high

    # define false-positives to exclude them
    exceptions:
      CVE-1230: not applicable
      CVE-3332: also not applicable
    # CVE-Key: exclusion note
```
