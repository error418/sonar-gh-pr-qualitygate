## Swingletree Workflow

The tools of a CI build often produce machine-readable reports. These reports can be consumed by
a plugin provided by Swingletree.

Some plugins (like plugin-sonarqube or plugin-nebula) send their build report directly to Swingletree. You will need a Build UID
attached to the reports to identify the build run (the UID can be retrieved using yoke).

Yoke simpifies collecting and sending reports to Swingletree. It can be used to send report files generated by the current build.

    C --collect--> yoke
    
    yoke --report--> swing
    tool --report--> swing
    
    swing --> gh
    swing --> elastic
</div>

Swingletree processes the reports and attaches the information to the commits in GitHub. It also persists the report data
to ElasticSearch, if the History-Feature is enabled.
