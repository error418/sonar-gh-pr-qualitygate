            <h2>Check Pull Requests</h2>
            <p>
                SonarQube findings are annotated and updated inside your Pull Requests.
                If the built-in SonarQube Branch Analysis quality gates are not fulfilled,
                the Pull Request can be blocked from merging.
            </p>

            <h2>Code Annotations</h2>
            <p>
                Swingletree annotates the code inside the Pull Request with the SonarQube findings. Developers do not
                have to leave GitHub.

            <h2>Check Runs</h2>
            <p>
                Posting and deleting analysis results as comments into the Pull Request conversation clutters
                the discussion and may lead to misunderstandings due to automated deletions.
                Swingletree uses GitHub Checks to inform users about the status of their Pull Request,
                which is a more fitting way of pointing out issues.
