# Swingletree

Use SonarQube Quality Gates inside your GitHub Pull Requests.

## Intention

Tracking your code quality across you branches is a good thing - especially when it comes to approving pull requests.

Swingletree gives you the possibility to automatically block pull requests on failing quality gates performed by the SonarQube branch plugin.
